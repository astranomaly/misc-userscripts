# misc-userscripts
Some tiny userscripts I've made that aren't important enough for their own repo

These scripts rely on the Greasemonkey API v3. This means they will not function in the latest versions of Greasemonkey, but will work with other common userscript extensions such as [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) or [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/).

They can be installed by navigating to the "raw" file links when you have a userscript extension installed in your browser.
